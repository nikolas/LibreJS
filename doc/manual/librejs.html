<a name="index-overview"></a>
<p>GNU LibreJS &mdash;an add-on for GNU IceCat and Mozilla Firefox&mdash; detects
and blocks nonfree nontrivial JavaScript while allowing its execution on
pages containing code that is either trivial and/or free.
</p>
<p>Many websites run nontrivial JavaScript on your computer. Some use it
for complex tasks; many use it gratuitously for minor jobs that could be
done easily with plain HTML.  Sometimes this JavaScript code is
malicious.  Either way, the JavaScript code is often nonfree.  For
explanation of the issue, see &quot;The JavaScript
Trap&quot;(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html</a>).
</p>
<p>If you care about freedom in your computing, and don&rsquo;t wish to let all
and sundry make you run nonfree programs, now you can prevent it by
using LibreJS.

<ul>
<li> LibreJS is not a security tool. Its goal is to detect nonfree nontrivial
JavaScript, and it currently does not detect whether free or trivial
code is malicious or not. Other free Mozilla extensions and add-ons may
be available for this purpose.

</li><li> LibreJS is always a work in progress. If you find a bug, please report
it to <a href="mailto:bug-librejs@gnu.org">bug-librejs@gnu.org</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Installation</h2>
<a name="index-Installation"></a>

<p>You can install LibreJS directly using a generated <samp>librejs.xpi</samp>
file, or by building it from source.
</p>

<a name="Building-the-Package"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.1 Building the Package</h3>
<p>After installing <code>jpm</code>, you should be able to use the <code>make</code>
command to build LibreJS from source.
</p>
<p>After running <code>make</code>, a new file, <samp>librejs.xpi</samp> should be
generated. This is the file that can be installed in a Mozilla browser. 
</p>
<a name="Installing-LibreJS"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.2 Installing LibreJS</h3>
<p>To install the add-on for all users, run:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sudo make install
</pre></div>

<p>or as root:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">make install
</pre></div>

<p>Next time you open a Mozilla-browser as a user of your system, you
should be notified that a new add-on (in this case, LibreJS) as been
installed and whether to allow it to run or not.

<h3 class="section">4.1 LibreJS in action</h3>

<p>After installing the add-on, you will see the LibreJS widget in the
add-on bar at the bottom of the browser window.  After loading a page,
left-click on the widget to view the deactivated JavaScript code from
the page (both on page and external) and, if applicable, the scripts
that were accepted.
</p>
<a name="Complaint-Feature"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.2 Complaint Feature</h3>

<p>It is very important to complain when a site has nonfree JavaScript
code, especially if it won&rsquo;t work without that code.  LibreJS makes it
easy to complain by heuristically finding where to send the complaint.
</p>
<p>When nonfree/nontrivial code is detected in a page, LibreJS attempts to
find a relevant contact link or email for the website you are
visiting. In order to do so, it will attempt to visit a few links from
the current page (for instance, a link labeled &ldquo;contact&rdquo; on the same
domain as the current page, &hellip;)
</p>
<p>LibreJS detects contact pages, email addresses that are likely to be
owned by the maintainer of the site, Twitter and identi.ca links, and
phone numbers.
</p>
<p>After LibreJS detects any of the above, a &ldquo;Complain&rdquo; tab will appear
on the right of your web browser. When you click on this tab, a large
panel will appear with contact information. Ideally, at the top you will
find the email address of the maintainer, labeled as the &ldquo;Email you
should use&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>When you complain to the website for their nonfree nontrivial
JavaScript, provide them with the link to the JavaScript Trap essay so
that they can get more information on what the issue is and how they can
solve it on their own site.
</p>
<p>LibreJS includes a default subject line and body for the complaint email,
with a link to the JavaScript Trap essay. This can be configured in the
LibreJS add-on preferences in your web browser.
</p>

<a name="Options"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.3 Options</h3>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Whitelist</em></dt>
<dd><p>LibreJS lets you whitelist domain names and subdomains to bypass the
regular JavaScript check. This might be useful, for example, if you are
running your own code in a local web server. In order to add a
whitelisted domain or url, go to Tools &gt;&gt; Add-ons, or press <kbd>Control
+ Shift + A</kbd>. Inside the add-on window, click on <em>Extensions</em>, and in
the list, where you see LibreJS, click on the <em>Preferences</em> button.
You will see an input field labeled <em>Whitelist</em>. In the field,
enter comma-separated domain names. Do not enter the protocol. For
instance to whitelist all the pages of <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a> and
<a href="https://gnu.org">https://gnu.org</a>, enter &lsquo;<samp>gnu.org</samp>&rsquo;. To allow all subdomains from
gnu.org, enter: &lsquo;<samp>*.gnu.org</samp>&rsquo;. This will match such sites as
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org">http://savannah.gnu.org</a> and <a href="http://audio-video.gnu.org">http://audio-video.gnu.org</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="chapter">5 JavaScript Detection</h2>
<a name="index-javascript"></a>

<ul>
<li>LibreJS considers JavaScript on a page nontrivial if any of the
following are true:

</li><li> It makes an AJAX request or is loaded along with scripts that make
an AJAX request,

</li><li> It loads external scripts dynamically or is loaded along with
scripts that do,

</li><li> It defines functions or methods and either loads an external script
(from HTML) or is loaded as one,

</li><li> It uses dynamic JavaScript constructs that are difficult to analyze
without interpreting the program or is loaded along with scripts
that use such constructs. These constructs are:
<ul>
<li> Using the eval function
</li><li> Calling methods with the square bracket notation
</li><li> Using any other construct than a string literal with certain methods
(<code>Obj.write</code>, <code>Obj.createElement</code>, &hellip;).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>In practice, the JavaScript code in your page may be found trivial by
LibreJS if, as a whole:
</p><ul>
<li> It does not define functions and it does not load external scripts
(with the HTML src attribute in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag).

</li><li> It does not make AJAX calls.

</li><li> It does not load external scripts with dynamic constructs.

</li><li> It does not use constructs that may be used to do any of the above in
a non-obvious way (use of the <code>eval()</code> method, use of square bracket
method calls, use of concatenation with certain constructs or method
calls, &hellip;).

</li></ul>

<p>However, in some instances, you may be required by LibreJS to add a
stylized comment to JavaScript code that may be otherwise trivial.
</p>
<p>When an external file defines a function, it becomes available
to all other external scripts. That is the case if another script
defines a function that makes AJAX calls, when an external script
loads other scripts dynamically (which in turn could also make AJAX
calls, &hellip;), or when a script is written with constructs that may do
any of these.
</p>
<p>For instance, if your page contains the following:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;script src=&quot;jquery.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$.doSomething();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>While <code>$.doSomething();</code> may seem trivial, you will nevertheless
have to add a stylized license comment on your main HTML page because
the external script (in this case jQuery) has been found to define
methods that make AJAX calls. <code>$.doSomething()</code> might make an AJAX call,
and LibreJS does not check for that.  The rule of thumb is that when you
use a library or code that handles AJAX, JSON, JSONP, the loading of
scripts dynamically, you should have license mentions for all your
JavaScript files and for your main page regardless. In practice this is
a case that happens very often with code that uses libraries.
</p>
<p>In practice also, the JavaScript code in an external file (an external
<samp>.js</samp> file loaded on your page) may be found trivial if it does not
define functions/methods.
</p>
<p>And in the same manner it will be considered nontrivial if AJAX calls,
dynamic script loading, or non-obvious dynamic JavaScript constructs
are used in another script.
</p>
<p>If your JavaScript code makes AJAX requests, it&rsquo;s important to get an
accurate <em>Content-Type</em> in the response from the server. For
example, if you&rsquo;re using JSON, set it to <code>application/json</code>.
This is because LibreJS alters the content of <code>text/html</code>
responses.

<a name="index-freelicenses"></a>

<a name="Detected-Free-Licenses"></a>
<h3 class="section">6.1 Detected Free Licenses</h3>

<p>In order for a file to be detected as free, the license notice should
appear in a JavaScript file above all code, at the very top of the file.
</p>
<p>For inline JavaScript code inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in HTML pages,
the license notice should appear once per page as a comment inside a
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, before all the code in that script. When the only
inline JavaScript code is within element attributes (<code>onload</code>,
<code>onclick</code>), place the license notice in an otherwise empty
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> at the top of the page. This is sometimes needed when an
external script performs AJAX calls or embeds scripts dynamically, and
the only inline JavaScript is an event attribute making a method call,
e.g.: <code>&lt;body onload=&quot;methodCall('remote-data.xml');&quot;&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>When people speak of the &ldquo;MIT license&rdquo; they mean either the X11 license
or the Expat license.  Please see which license the code uses, and label
it accordingly.
</p>
<p>Currently LibreJS checks for the following licenses:

<a name="Setting-Your-JavaScript-Free-1"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">7 Setting Your JavaScript Free</h2>

<p>The first step is releasing your JavaScript under a free license. If
you are already using a free library, or you&rsquo;re not using any
third-party libraries, it might only take a few minutes.
</p>
<p>All JavaScript code on a web page (inline, on-page, and external) shares
a common scope. Thus, code is generally either rejected or accepted as a
whole by LibreJS. If some JavaScript code is found to be nontrivial and
nonfree, then most of the time, all the the rest is discarded as well.
</p>
<p>On your website, take a look at your HTML source. You can identify
distinct pieces of JavaScript that might be free and some other that are
nonfree.
</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: By running LibreJS on your page, you will get a list of all the
JavaScript that was blocked. This gives you an overview of the
JavaScript in your page.
</p>
<p>Imagine a page that contains several pieces of JavaScript from various
sources:
</p><ul>
<li> On top, within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, it includes jQuery

</li><li> Then, some JavaScript code that you have written

</li><li> At the bottom, a JavaScript-based Facebook widget

</li><li> Also, there&rsquo;s some analytics tracking code
</li></ul>


<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>JavaScript that is already free</em></dt>
<dd><p>First, you must ensure that the library is free. If the file contains
a copyright and a license notice, you won&rsquo;t need to look any further.
But if there&rsquo;s no mention of the license, or if it&rsquo;s too brief, you&rsquo;ll
have to look for a COPYING or LICENSE file within the original library&rsquo;s
source package, or on the library&rsquo;s official website.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Your own JavaScript</em></dt>
<dd><p>The free license given to your code should be compatible with the rest
of the JavaScript on a page. A good way to check is to read up on
them: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Nonfree JavaScript</em></dt>
<dd><p>This might be the case with an analytics tracker, social media
widgets, and code that runs ads. Removing these pieces of code from your
site is required to have the rest accepted as free. There are
often alternatives to nonfree libraries or to third-party services:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If you have used nonfree third-party code as the base to write your own
code, try to find a free alternative.

</li><li> If you&rsquo;re using a third-party service such as an analytics service,
replace it with a free alternative like Piwik.

</li><li> If you can&rsquo;t find free JavaScript that has already been developed,
write it yourself! Who knows, your own solution might be the start of
a brilliant project!
</li></ul>

</dd>
</dl>

<a name="JavaScript-Web-Labels"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.1 JavaScript Web Labels</h3>
<p>One way to make your website work with LibreJS is by defining a
JavaScript Web Labels table.
</p>
<p>A JavaScript Web Labels table is informative to both site visitors and
the LibreJS program. You make a Web Labels table on a new HTML page
that&rsquo;s linked to from your main page. The table lists each of your
site&rsquo;s JavaScript files, that file&rsquo;s corresponding human-readable source
file, and the canonical url of its free license.
</p>
<p>When using a JavaScript Web Labels table for your own files, it&rsquo;s
important to put a copying permission statement at the top of each source
file listed in right-most column of the Web Labels table. For info on how
properly release your code as free software, see
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html</a>. Future versions of
LibreJS will require a copying permission statement or other license
notice for source files listed in a Web Labels table.
</p>
<p>More information on JavaScript Web Labels is detailed here:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/free-your-javascript.html#step3">https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/free-your-javascript.html#step3</a>
and here:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/javascript-labels.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/javascript-labels.html</a>.
</p>
<a name="Specifying-multiple-licenses-for-a-single-JavaScript-file"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">7.1.1 Specifying multiple licenses for a single JavaScript file</h4>

<p>If you compile or concatenate your JavaScript into a single file, the
source files you&rsquo;re combining may be released under different licenses.
You can specify multiple licenses for the file in a JavaScript Web Labels
table, like this:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">&lt;table id=&quot;jslicense-labels1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;all.min.js&quot;&gt;all.min.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html&quot;
                &gt;GPL-3.0+&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&quot;
                &gt;Apache-2.0&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;gpl-script.js&quot;&gt;gpl-script.js&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;apache-script.js&quot;&gt;apache-script.js&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags just make the table more understandable when
looking at the rendered version of it on the license page. They aren&rsquo;t
required by LibreJS.
</p>
<p>If all the licenses contained in the second column are recognized by
LibreJS to be free licenses, then LibreJS will allow the file in the
first column to be run.
</p>
<a name="Adding-a-stylized-comment-in-your-JavaScript-files-and-on-your-page"></a>
<h3 class="section">7.2 Adding a stylized comment in your JavaScript files and on your page</h3>
<p>See a &ldquo;Convention for releasing free JavaScript programs&rdquo; in the
JavaScript Trap <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html</a>
</p>
<p>Adding this notice will ensure LibreJS will find the JavaScript file to
be free. The <code>@licstart</code> and <code>@licend</code> lines at the
beginning and end of the stylized comment are necessary to make a clear
statement that the _entire code_ in the file is free. This means that
you must ensure that no nonfree code was carelessly appended at the end
of the file.
</p>
<p>In the main HTML page, the license notice covers JavaScript contained
in all <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with on-page code and the inline
JavaScript (in event attributes such as onload, onclick, etc, &hellip;).
Since external files have their own stylized comment, they are
not covered by the notice in the main HTML page. Make sure to identify
all the licenses available. LibreJS will only ensure it matches a
notice of an allowed license once, so the order does not matter, but
the responsibility is on you to make sure all code is under the free
licenses mentioned between <code>@licstart</code> and <code>@licend</code>.
</p>
<p>You should make <em>only</em> one <code>@licstart</code> <code>@licend</code>
comment in your page, since it pertains to the entire code on page
across all <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags and inline html attributes.
</p>
<p>When you use the JavaScript Web Labels method, you should still include a
license notice at the top of each of your source files. This ensures that
if someone copies the file and uses it for something else, the license
remains intact.
</p>

<h3 class="appendixsec">A.1 Mozilla Browser</h3>

<p>You will need one of the many flavors of the Mozilla browser to use
LibreJS. It can be installed on the following:
</p>
<p>GNU IceCat,  Mozilla Firefox, Trisquel Abrowser, Debian Iceweasel.
</p>
<p>LibreJS works on these browsers starting from version 29. We
recommend that you use the latest version of your Mozilla browser.
LibreJS has been tested extensively on multiple GNU/Linux distributions,
but it is compatible any operating system as long as you&rsquo;re using a
compatible Mozilla browser.
</p>
<a name="Mozilla_0027s-Jetpack-Manager-for-Node_002ejs"></a>
<h3 class="appendixsec">A.2 Mozilla&rsquo;s Jetpack Manager for Node.js</h3>
<p>LibreJS uses the Mozilla <code>jpm</code> tool, a set of utilities for
creating, testing, running and packaging Mozilla Jetpack Addons.
</p>
<p>You do not need <code>jpm</code> to use the LibreJS xpi file or to install it
using the packaged version, but it is required in order to package the
LibreJS source code into an xpi file. If you would like to run the
tests for LibreJS or make changes to the source files, you
will need <code>jpm</code> as well. For the &ldquo;make&rdquo; command to work
properly, you must have the <code>jpm</code> command available on your system
from the command line.
</p>
<p>You can find information on getting <code>jpm</code> at these links:
</p>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B LibreJS Internals</h2>

<p>LibreJS intercepts HTTP responses and rewrites their contents after
analyzing JavaScript within them. It does not remove script nodes and
attributes from the page, but instead &ldquo;deactivates&rdquo; them by modifying
the <code>type</code> and <code>src</code> attributes on script elements and by
moving the contents of inline JavaScript attributes such as onClick
into harmless attributes.
</p>
<p>LibreJS detects the most common cases using the HTTP response method
described above, but in extremely rare cases, or when running code
locally, LibreJS cannot detect JavaScript during the response stage.
</p>
<p>To remedy this issue, and as a final safeguard, LibreJS takes a look
at the scripts that are about to be executed while the browser engine is
parsing the page. If the script is not found in a list of accepted
scripts populated earlier, the execution will be prevented. This is to
ensure content types that are not regular HTML (binhex with HTML in it,
&hellip;) and JavaScript do not fall through the cracks and get executed.

<p>In order to better understand how LibreJS works, you can try to visit
these pages with LibreJS installed and enabled and see how they are
being processed:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-trivial-external/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-trivial-external/</a>
This page contains trivial on-page JavaScript code, and an external
script that contains trivial JavaScript code.  Therefore, all JavaScript
is being executed.


</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-nontrivial-external/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-nontrivial-external/</a>
The on-page script here is trivial and uses a built-in method, but the
external script in this page is nontrivial (defines a function.)  The
external script is blocked, the inline script is executed.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/nontrivial-inline-trivial-external/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/nontrivial-inline-trivial-external/</a>
This page contains nontrivial code on page, and trivial code in its
external page.  All JavaScript is <em>removed</em> from the page, and the
external script is never analyzed, since the nontrivial conditions are
already met in the page.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/free-inline-free-external/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/free-inline-free-external/</a>
This page contains free on-page (GPL 3) JavaScript, and free external
Javascript. Therefore all JavaScript is being executed.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/free-inline-nonfree-nontrivial-external/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/free-inline-nonfree-nontrivial-external/</a>
This page contains free on-page JavaScript. The external script contains
nonfree nontrivial JavaScript (AJAX request). The free code that is
inline is executed, but the external file is blocked.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/intrinsec-event/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/intrinsec-event/</a> This page
contains trivial on-page code, with an intrinsic event in an html
attribute (onload).  All JavaScript is being executed.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-free-external-defines-function/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-free-external-defines-function/</a>
This page contains on-page trivial JavaScript (only makes a window alert
and loads an external script using the html &lt;script&gt; tag with the src
attribute. The external script is free (GPL v3), and since it is only
nontrivial because it defines a function, the on-page trivial code is
allowed to use it.  All JavaScript is being executed.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-free-external-writes-script/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/trivial-inline-free-external-writes-script/</a>
This page contains trivial on-page JavaScript code, and loads an
external script that is free. Since no function is defined, the external
script is being analyzed. The external script is free. Trivial here is
not allowed because the external script, although free, writes a
script. The inline trivial script should also have a free license notice
for it to be interpreted.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/shelltypist/demo/real-life-example-with-jquery-free.html">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/shelltypist/demo/real-life-example-with-jquery-free.html</a>
This is a real-life example of a small jQuery plugin. The on-page
JavaScript code has a free license. The jQuery external file has a free
licensed. The shelltypist.js file has a free license as well. All
licenses are defined between <code>@licstart</code> and <code>@licend</code>. All
JavaScript is executed.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/shelltypist/demo/same-page-without-free-license.html">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/shelltypist/demo/same-page-without-free-license.html</a>
This is the same page than the previous example, except it does not have
a free license for the main HTML page on-page script. While the actual
code there is trivial, since jQuery defines methods that make use of
AJAX, trivial code is not allowed, and no JavaScript is executed.

</li><li> <a href="http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/test-labels/">http://lduros.net/assets/librejs/tests/test-labels/</a> This page
contains JavaScript (jQuery minified) that does not have proper license
information in the file, as it has no <code>@licstart</code> <code>@licend</code>
comment. It would be considered nonfree, however, the page itself uses
the JavaScript Web Labels method. On the page itself, you will find a
link labeled &ldquo;JavaScript License Information&rdquo;, which leads to a page
that contains a properly formatted table with the required data on the
external JavaScript file. LibreJS visits this link and determines the
version of jQuery linked from the original page is the one listed there,
and flags it as free. All JavaScript is executed (and the title should
turn green.)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre></div>

<ol>
<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
</p>

<a name="ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"></a>
<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
</p>
